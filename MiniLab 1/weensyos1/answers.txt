Response to Exercise 1:
The sys_getpid() call will have returned the correct value since before the schedule(), the process id, pid, has already been copied and stored in the register %eax. Actually, the sys_getpid() call solely reads from the register and schedule() never changes what has been stored in %eax, so the returned value will be correct.
